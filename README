GrowLView
(C)2011 Faye Pearson, ZIPPYSoft.

Beginnings of a LiveView implementation in ObjectiveC for Cocoa.
Tested on OSX Snow Leopard 10.6.6

Thanks to Andrew de Quincey (adq.livejournal.com) for his work analysing the
protocol which I have gleaned from the python "liveview" project in.

Please feel free to drop me comments or fork.

If you get it talking to Growl (or Cydia) before I do, please let me know!

You can find the latest version on git://github.com/fayep/GrowLView.git
